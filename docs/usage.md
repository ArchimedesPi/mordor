## Mordor is simple/stupid. All it does is 
	* Install itself
## Then you can
	* Install software (really git clone a sh script and run it)
	* Parse dependancies from that script
	* Install ALL the dependancies!
	* And the software - don't forget that
## The command line syntax is:
### > mordor <url> [...]
## where
###	+ <url> is a URL to a git repo containing a file `Orcfile`.
####		+ <url> can be:
#####		|______ + `gist:<gitid>` Enter a gist ID, the gist should contain an Orcfile
#####		|______ + `git:<url>`	URL to a git repo, `git://` or `ssh://` or `https://` should work!
###	+ The rest of the arguments are passed to the Orcfile



##   That's all,
