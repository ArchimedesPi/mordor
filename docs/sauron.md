# Sauron

is the *big dude* / the main _balrog_ (not in LOtR, but it'll suffice...).

Basically the structure of Sauron is as follows (pardon bad ASCII art):

	https://github.com/ArchimedesPi/sauron
		|
		\
		|-- foobar
		|	|______ Orcfile
		|
		|-- drumpkin
		|	|______ Orcfile
		.
		.
		.

So it's the main Balrog! (see [Balrogs](balrogs.md))
