# Orcfiles

##*Orcfiles should have the following metadata within the first 10 lines!!!*
````bash
#name:i-am-a-package;
#description:I have stuff;
#version:3.141;
#dependancies:sauron@foobar sauron@teddybear;
````

Each `#<tag>:` is the tag, and everything after that before ; is the content.
The acceptable tags are (needed tags in _bold_):

	* _name_
	* _description_
	* _version_
	* _dependancies_
	* author (to be implemented)
	* email (to be implemented)
	* team (to be implemented)
	* copyright (to be implemented)
	* date (to be implemented)
	* release (to be implemented)

Put them in any order!
*BUT THEY MUST BE IN THE FIRST 10 LINES!*
